        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Ethan Diep. I'm a tenth grade 
            student from William Lyon Mackenzie. In 
            my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano 
            and coding. I also play badminton on the 
            weekends. My coding journey started when 
            I began learning HTML and CSS in middle 
            school from

            <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>.
            This is where I got most of my 
            web-dev knowledge and was my first real 
            exposure to programming. I then learned 
            Processing in Grade 9 for the ICS2OP course. 
            I also picked up Python over that summer 
            because I wanted to learn a more widely 
            used programming language. I am currently 
            learning Java as part of the Grade 12 ICS4UP
            course. My dream is to one day become a 
            full-time programmer.
