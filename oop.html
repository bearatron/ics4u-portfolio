        <h1>OOP</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Java was designed as an object oriented programming language 
            or OOP for short. This way of designing programs is modelled 
            after the real world. There are a few things common between 
            objects in code and objects in real life. Take houses for 
            example. They can have their own attributes, such as the number 
            of floors, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc. Some of these attributes 
            can be changed, for example you can renovate your house to include 
            a second floor, while others are fixed. There are certain things 
            you can do to a house. For instance, you can clean or repair the 
            house. There are also things that a house can do. It provides a 
            space for you to live in and a place for you to cook, eat and 
            sleep. These are called behaviors. Luckily, all of the things 
            we have just discussed above can be applied to programming as well, 
            with some minor differences. Before we make any objects, we need 
            to define a class. Think of a class as like a blueprint. Just 
            like a house needs a blueprint before it is built, we need a 
            class before we construct objects. The advantage of this is that 
            we can reuse the same blueprint on multiple objects. Let's see 
            how this is written in code.
        </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="language-java">class House {
    // attributes
    private String address;
    private int floors;
    private int bedrooms;
    private int bathrooms;
    private double squareFeet;

    // no argument constructor
    public House() {
        address = "";
        floors = 1;
        bedrooms = 2;
        bathrooms = 1;
        squareFeet = 1500;
    }

    // constructor
    public House(String a, int f, int bdrms, int btrms, double sqft) {
        address = a;
        floors = f;
        bedrooms = bdrms;
        bathrooms = btrms;
        squareFeet = sqft;
    }

    // behaviors
    public void addFloor() {
        floors += 1;
        squareFeet += 1000;
    }

    public String getAddress() {
        return address;
    }

    public int getFloors() {
        return floors;
    }

    public int getBedrooms() {
        return bedrooms;
    }

    public int getBathrooms() {
        return bathrooms;
    }

    public double getSquareFeet() {
        return squareFeet;
    }
}</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        As you can see in the above code sample, the house class contains 
        attributes and behaviors that are both seen in real world houses. 
        There are also two special methods called the constructors. As its 
        name suggests, it helps construct a house object. Take a look at the 
        following code snippet.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="language-java">House genericHouse = new House();
House myHouse = new House("123 Example Road", 2, 3, 2, 2000.20);</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        It creates two objects, one named genericHouse and the other named 
        myHouse. Notice how in initializing the genericHouse variable, we 
        call the first House constructor (House()). genericHouse now has the 
        values we set in the previous code snippet. On the other hand, the 
        myHouse is initialized by calling the overloaded constructor. It sets 
        the address, floors, bedrooms, bathrooms and square feet of the house, 
        all in the constructor. Now, we can use dot notation to call the methods 
        we created. For example:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="language-java">House myHouse = new House("123 Example Road", 2, 3, 2, 2000.20);
System.out.println(myHouse.getFloors());
System.out.println(myHouse.getSquareFeet());
myHouse.addFloor();
System.out.println(myHouse.getFloors());
System.out.println(myHouse.getSquareFeet());</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        The above code would output:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="text">2
2000.20
3
3000.20</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        As you can see, this prints the result of the method call to the getFloors() 
        and getSquareFeet() methods before and after calling addFloor(). The addFloor() 
        method adds 1000 square feet and increases the number of floors by one, as shown 
        in the output.
    </p>

    <h2>Inheritance</h2>

    <p>
        Now let's look at a more sophisticated way we can make use of object oriented 
        programming called inheritance. Just like you inherit your genes from your parents, 
        classes can also inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes. The parent class 
        is also called the super class and the child class is called the sub class. Let's see 
        how this looks in code.
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code class="language-java">public class Parent {
    int age;
    double weight;
    double height;
    String hairColor;

    public Parent(int a, double w, double h, String hc) {
        age = a;
        weight = w;
        height = h;
        hairColor = hc;
    }

    public void displayHairColor() {
        System.out.println(hairColor);
    }
}

public class Child extends Parent {
    public Child(int a, double w, double h, String hc) {
        super(a, w, h, hc);
    }
}</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        As you can see, the class constructor of Child calls its superclass (Parent) constructor.
