                    During LyonHacks III, I create (along with three other students), 
                    created a multi-platform application using Flutter. Our app was 
                    named CookEase and it helped the user find recipes based on their 
                    diet, food in their kitchen, preferred cuisines, and dietary 
                    restrictions. We only had two and a half days to make this, and 
                    we were really proud of what we were able to accomplish, as none of 
                    us had any knowledge of the Flutter framework. Personally, I gained 
                    two key pieces of knowledge including Flutter UI design and 
                    how to make API calls in Dart, both of which will be extremely useful 
                    if I decide to develop apps with Flutter in the future.

                    Over the summer of 2022, I decided to embark on my first real project. At 
                    this point, I was only starting to learn Python and wanted to work on 
                    something that striked a balance between fuelling my curiosity while not 
                    being frustratingly difficult to accomplish. I decided to go with making an 
                    online web based chat app, primarily inspired by Discord. I learned how to use 
                    the Python library Flask for basic back end to connect users to the right chat 
                    room based on a unique URL.
