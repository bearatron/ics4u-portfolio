                    During LyonHacks III, I create (along with three other students), 
                    created a multi-platform application using Flutter. Our app was 
                    named CookEase and it helped the user find recipes based on their 
                    diet, food in their kitchen, preferred cuisines, and dietary 
                    restrictions. We only had two and a half days to make this, and 
                    we were really proud of what we were able to accomplish, as none of 
                    us had any knowledge of the Flutter framework. Personally, I gained 
                    two key pieces of knowledge including Flutter UI design and 
                    how to make API calls in Dart, both of which will be extremely useful 
                    if I decide to develop apps with Flutter in the future.

                <h2>Chat App</h2>
                <p>
                    Over the summer of 2022, I decided to embark on my first real project. At 
                    this point, I was only starting to learn Python and wanted to work on 
                    something that striked a balance between fuelling my curiosity while not 
                    being frustratingly difficult to accomplish. I decided to go with making an 
                    online web based chat app, primarily inspired by Discord. I learned how to use 
                    the Python library Flask for basic back end to connect users to the right chat 
                    room based on a unique URL.

                <h2>Checkers</h2>
                <p>
                    For the grade 11 ICS course final project, I made a checkers game in collaboration 
                    with Glen. Among some of the features in our project was the ability to save and 
                    load files as well as a leaderboard to locally store the highest scores. One of the 
                    more difficult aspects of the game was to try to detect whether or not a move was 
                    valid. This is because you had to take into account the fact that there are kings 
                    are in the game. Also, it was kind of difficult to check if it's a draw. This is 
                    because it required having to find every single possible move and see if any 
                    of these moves are possible. However, I was pretty proud of this project.

                <h2>Walkademic</h2>
                <p>
                    For the grade 11 ICS course final project, I worked on a game that was targeted to 
                    young kids to help them to cross the road. The inspiration we got for this project 
                    came from the fact that it was common for parents to discuss road safety to kids. 
                    As for making the actual game, we used a Java game library called libGDX as we 
                    thought it would be easier compared to using Swing. However, it proved to be 
                    challenging to figure out how to use the library since we have never used a game 
                    library before. Despite this, I was proud of our final game because it reflected 
                    our hard work and perseverance.
