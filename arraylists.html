        <h1>ArrayLists</h1>

        <p>
            Although arrays are useful for storing a list of information, 
            their length is immutable. That means that new elements cannot be added/removed. This is where arraylists come into play. Take a look at the declaration and initialization of an arraylist.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
arr.add(1);
arr.add(0, 2);</code>
        </pre>

        <p>Note how we are using the Integer class instead of the primitive. We use the .add() method to append 1 to the end of the arraylist on line 2. On the next line, we pass in two parameters to the .add() method. The first parameter is the index of which to add the number to, and the second parameter is the number itself. Therefore, the final array would be [2, 1]. You can also call .remove() with a parameter which specifies the index to remove from the arraylist.
            <br>
            To get the size of an arraylist, you can use the .size() method, just like how you'd use the length property on an array. To access an element at an index, use the .get() method by passing in the index as a parameter. Take a look at the example below.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i ++) {
    System.out.println(arr.get(i));
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            There are also other useful methods that you can use with arraylists. Just like how you can reassign a variable at an index, you can use the .set() method to set the element at an index (specified by the first parameter) to the value at the second parameter.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Mistake</h2>
        <p>
            The method .size() finds the size of an arraylist and changes when elements are added or removed. Consider the following code.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
arr.add(1);
arr.add(2);
arr.add(3);

for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i ++) {
    arr.remove(i);
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            This might be a sample program that one may write. However, this doesn't work as intended. During the first iteration of the loop, it removes 1. During the second iteration, the program removes 3 (since it is now at index 1). The program then exits on the next iteration, leaving 2 still in the arraylist. Instead of this, you should do the following.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">while (arr.size() > 0) {
    arr.remove(0);
}</code>
        </pre>
