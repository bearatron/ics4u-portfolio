        <h1>ArrayLists</h1>
        <p>
            Arrays are used to store a collection of data from the same datatype. The 
            basic declaration and initialization of an array is as follows.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">int[] sampleArray; // declaration
sampleArray = new int[10]; // initialization of the array with length 10
sampleArray = new int[] {5, 8, 2}; // initialization of the array with 3 preset elements

// declaration and initialization in the same line
int[] sampleArray = new int[10];
int[] sampleArray = new int[] {5, 8, 2};</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Note that int can be replaced with any other datatype and that the length 
            can be any positive integer. Also note that if you initialize an array by 
            specifying its length, Java initializes it with default values depending on 
            the datatype for that array. In this case, line 2 of the above code would 
            initialize the array with ten elements of 0. For strings, the default value 
            is null, for booleans it's false, and for floats and doubles, the default 
            value is 0.0. Once an array is initialized, its datatype and length cannot 
            be changed.
        </p>
        <h2>Iteration</h2>
        <p>
            Similar to how we might number our grocery list, Java numbers each element 
            (or value) in an array, however it starts from 0. That means that if we had 
            the array [2, 4, 6, 8], the element 2 is at index 0 in the array. A common 
            operation is iterating through an array to get each element. Let's say we 
            were given an array of doubles and wanted to figure out the average value 
            of all the elements inside. We can do this in one of two ways. The first of 
            which uses a for loop. We can iterate through each index in the array. Take 
            a look at the code below.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-java">int[] numArray = [2, 4, 8, 3, 1, 0]
int sum;
for (int i = 0; i < numArray; i ++) {
    sum += numArray[i];
}

System.out.println((double)sum/numArray.length);</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            In this example, we initialize an array to store some integers we want to find 
            the average of and a sum variable to store the sum of these integers. Then, we 
            iterate through the array using a for loop, adding each element to the variable 
            that stores the total sum. Lastly, we display the divided number to the console.
            For loops are not the only ways to iterate through arrays. A simple operation 
            such as this can be accomplished by using for-each loops. The above for loop 
            could be replaced with the following.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">for (int i : numArray) {
    sum += i;
}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            As you can see, the for-each loop iterates through the actual elements in the 
            array, rather than just the indexes.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Mistake</h2>
        <p>
            Although the for-each loop is great for iterating through an array's elements, 
            you cannot modify the array with them. They are only used for accessing its 
            values. If you want to modify an array, you must access its index and reassign 
            the element at that index. An example is shown below.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">String[] names = new int[] {“Abe”, “Bob”, “Dave”, “Dan”};
names[2] = “Carl”;</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            If you want to replace an array with another array, that can be done with a for loop.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-java">double[] marks = new double[] {90.2, 93.9, 89.7};
double[] newMarks = new double[] {93.5, 92.3, 95.9};

for (int i = 0; i < marks.length; i ++) {
	marks[i] = newMarks[i];
}</code>
