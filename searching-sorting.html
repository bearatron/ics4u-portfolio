        <h1>Searching & Sorting</h1>
        <p>
            Searching in computer science terms, is the process of finding a 
            value within an array. Sorting is the process of arranging items 
            in an array so that they follow some arbitrary order (such as 
            alphabetically, or least to greatest). In this lesson, we'll take 
            a look at different searching and sorting algorithms and how fast 
            they run. The time it takes for an algorithm to run is measured 
            using big O notation, which is the relationship between the input 
            size and time it takes for the algorithm to run in the worst case 
            scenario. This will make more sense as we take a look at the time 
            complexity of actual searching and sorting algorithms.
        </p>

        <h2>Linear/sequential search</h2>
        
        <p>
            This is by far the simplest search algorithm to understand and 
            implement. Given an array of values, simply loop through the array 
            from start to finish until you reach the desired value. Sample code 
            for searching through an integer array is shown below.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">public static int sequentialSearch(int[] arr, int val) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i ++) {
        if (arr[i] == val) {
    return i;
    }
}
    return -1;
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            This algorithm runs in O(n) time. When analyzing an algorithm's time 
            complexity, it's helpful to identify the input you're dealing with. 
            In this case, it is the array to be searched. We want to know how long 
            the algorithm takes to run relative to larger input sizes. We can 
            represent the "size" of the input with the variable n for the length of 
            the array. The worst case scenario is when the element we want to find 
            is at the end of the array. That means we have to loop through every 
            single element in the array (all n elements). Therefore, the time 
            complexity of the algorithm is O(n).
        </p>

        <h2>Binary search</h2>

        <p>
            Although faster than linear/sequential search, binary search requires 
            the array to be sorted beforehand. The reason for this is that the entire 
            premise of this searching algorithm is to find the middle element of the 
            array and compare it to the desired element. If the element comes before 
            the middle element, we repeat the previous steps, except on the subarray 
            from the low element to the middle one. If the desired element comes after 
            the middle one, we look at the subarray from the middle element to the high 
            element. Let's take a look at the code.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">public static int binarySearch(int val, int arr[]) {
    int low = 0;
    int high = arr.length-1;
    int mid;
            
    while (low < high) {
        mid = (low + high)/2;
        
        if (arr[mid] == val) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] > val) {
            // val comes before the middle element
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            // val comes after the middle element
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
            
    return -1; // element not found
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            As you can see, we declare variables for the lower bound, upper bound and 
            middle indexes of the array. Inside the while loop, we first calculate the 
            middle index. Then, we look to see if it is equal to the value we are searching 
            for. If yes, then great, we just return the index of mid. Otherwise, we have 
            to look in one of the halves of the array. Since we know that the array is sorted, 
            we know that if the value is less than the array's middle element, it is in the 
            left half of the array. We set the upper bound to mid - 1 because we already know 
            the value we're looking for is not at mid, so we want to search the array from the 
            lower bound all the way to the middle index - 1. If the value we want isn't at the 
            middle or lower bound of the array, it must be at the upper bound. That's why we 
            adjust our lower bound to become the middle index + 1 (since we know val can't be 
            at the middle index). This process keeps repeating until we've found the value or 
            until the lower and upper indexes "overlap" (when low >= high). In this case, the 
            value is not in the array, so we just return -1. Let's take a look at a sample case 
            where we want to find the element 1 in the following array:
        </p>

        <pre><code>[1, 5, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20]</code></pre>

        <p>The table below shows the different variables at each iteration of the loop.</p>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Iteration number</th>
              <th><code>low</code></th>
              <th><code>high</code></th>
              <th><code>mid</code></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>0</td>
              <td>7</td>
              <td>3</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>0</td>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>0</td>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>0</td>
            </tr>
          </table>

          <p>
            As you can see, it took only 3 iterations in order to find the element. The array is of length 8, 
            and log<sub>2</sub>(8). We use 2 as the base of the logarithm because we're splitting the array into 2 subarrays 
            in each iteration. Knowing that the size of the array is n (or 8 in this case), we can conclude that 
            the time complexity of the algorithm is O(log<sub>2</sub>(n)). Keep in mind that this is only an approximation - 
            the exact number of iterations you have to go through depends on whether you round up or down when you 
            calculate the middle index. This means that if you tried to search for 20 in the above scenario, it 
            would actually take you 4 iterations to do so. Nevertheless when the input size becomes larger, 1 more 
            iteration won't matter. The idea of big O notation is to deal with calculation time as inputs become larger.
          </p>

          <h2>Selection sort</h2>

          <p>
            Selection sort is a pretty intuitive method of sorting an array. You start by searching the entire array 
            for the element that comes first in the array and put it at the beginning. Then, you repeat this process, 
            except in the subarray excluding the element you just sorted. Once you reach the last element, you've sorted 
            the array! Let's see how this is implemented in code.
        </p>
        
        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i ++) {
        int smallestIndex = i;
        int temp;

        // finding smallest element
        for (int j = i; j < arr.length; j ++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[smallestIndex]) {
                // assigning index of smallest element to smallestIndex
                smallestIndex = j;
            }
        }

        // swapping elements
        temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[smallestIndex]; // putting smallest index at the start of the subarray
        arr[smallestIndex] = temp; // putting the element at the start of the subarray to where the smallest element used to be
    }
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            The code is mostly self explanatory. The inner loop finds the greatest element. The outer loop is 
            responsible for swapping elements as well as for making sure that the inner loop doesn't iterate 
            through the already sorted elements. This sorting method, although easy to implement, is pretty 
            inefficient. In the worst case, it has to loop through each element (outer loop), and loop through 
            the total elements - the number of iterations the outer loop has done (inner loop). In big O notation, 
            we ignore constants (for an approximation). In this case, that means that we disregard the number of 
            iterations that the outer loop has done when calculating the number of elements the inner loop loops 
            through. This effectively means that we're looping through the array array.length * array.length times, 
            or n * n, or n<sup>2</sup> times, giving us the time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>).
        </p>

        <h2>Insertion sort</h2>

        <p>
            Just like selection sort, insertion sort is an easy algorithm to understand and implement. 
            Looking at each element of the array, we see if it's in the right order (if it comes before 
            the previous). If yes, we move on to the next element. Otherwise, we continuously swap the 
            previous element with the one we're currently on until it's in the right location. The code 
            is below.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">public static void insertionSort(int[] arr) {
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i ++) {
        int currentIndex = i; // index to keep track of where the current element is
        for (int j = i-1; j >= 0; j --) {				
            if (arr[j] < arr[currentIndex]) {
                // elements are in the correct order
                break;
            } else {
                // move current element to the left
                int temp = arr[j];
                arr[j] = arr[currentIndex];
                arr[currentIndex] = temp;
                currentIndex = j; // update the current element's index
            }

        }
    }
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            The outer for loop starts from the 2nd element in the array to avoid any IndexOutOfBounds 
            exceptions. If the current element is in the right position (it comes after the previous 
            one), then you leave it be. Otherwise, you continuously swap the current element with the 
            one before it until it's in the correct position (the inner for loop). Make sure to update 
            the position the current element the outer loop is at during each swap. Just like selection 
            sort, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>), because we're looping through n-1 
            elements in the outer loop and n-1-i elements in the inner loop. Removing constants, 
            we loop through n * n, or n<sup>2</sup> elements in total.
        </p>

        <h2>Merge sort</h2>

        <p>
            Out of all the sorting algorithms, merge sort is the fastest one, but it is a little bit 
            harder to understand. The foundation of this sorting algorithm is on the merge operation, 
            where you take two already sorted arrays and merge them. To do this, simply compare the 
            elements at the start of each array and put the smaller one in your sorted array. Continue 
            doing this until you have a sorted array. It's that simple. The code for this is below.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">public static ArrayList<Integer> merge(ArrayList<Integer> arr1, ArrayList<Integer> arr2) {
    int totalSize = arr1.size() + arr2.size(); // total initial size of both arrays

    ArrayList<Integer> mergedArr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    
    while(arr1.size() > 0 && arr2.size() > 0) {
        // choosing the smallest element to add to the sorted array (smaller numbers come first)
        if (arr1.get(0) < arr2.get(0)) {
            mergedArr.add(arr1.remove(0));
        } else {
            mergedArr.add(arr2.remove(0));
        }
    }

    // if all the elements have not been added yet, it means that one of the arraylists still has elements that have not been added to the sorted array
    // since both arr1 and arr2 are ordered, we can just add the remaining elements to the sorted array
    if (mergedArr.size() != totalSize) {
        if (arr1.size() > 0) {
            while (arr1.size() > 0) {
                mergedArr.add(arr1.remove(0));
            }
        } else {
            while (arr2.size() > 0) {
                mergedArr.add(arr2.remove(0));
            }
        }
    }

    return mergedArr; // returns the fully merged and sorted array
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Now, why does this operation matter to us? Don't we have to actually sort the arrays before 
            we can merge them? The answer to this question is... not really. You see, if arrays of size 
            1 are considered sorted. Therefore, we can just merge multiple arrays of size 1 together to 
            get a larger merged array, and merge the larger arrays together, and so on until we get our 
            fully sorted array. However, we need to break down the larger array into groups of 1 first. 
            To accomplish this, we will use <span><a href="./recursion.html">recursion</a></span>. We are also going to use arraylists, since they 
            are easier to manipulate. Given an arraylist arr, we'll return the same arraylist, but sorted. 
            Let's set up our method header. 
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">public static ArrayList<Integer> mergeSort(ArrayList<Integer> arr)</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            We want to stop the recursive calls when our subarrays are of size 1, so we'll add the 
            following if statement. This is our base case.
        </p>
        
        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">if (arr.size() == 1) {
return arr;
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>Perfect. Now, we'll need to split the array into two parts.</p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">ArrayList<Integer> left = new ArrayList<Integer>();
ArrayList<Integer> right = new ArrayList<Integer>();

for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i ++) {
    if (i < arr.size() / 2) {
        left.add(arr.get(i)); // store the first half of the arraylist
    } else {
        right.add(arr.get(i)); // store the second half of the arraylist
    }
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Finally, we can call mergeSort on the left and right arraylists and merge the two halves. 
            Why does this work? Well, this process will keep repeating until we reach our base case of 
            the arraylist's size being 1. Then, the size 1 arraylist will be returned, and the merge 
            method can begin merging the two returned arraylists. When the merge is complete, it returns 
            a larger sorted arraylist. This in turn gets returned to the mergeSort method that called the 
            merge method, and so on and so forth until the whole array is sorted. In all cases, merge 
            sort needs to divide the array repeatedly into two halves. In an arraylist with 8 elements, 
            the array is divided into groups of 4, 2, and 1 (log<sub>2</sub>(8) = 3). For each of these groups, we 
            need to merge them. This takes O(n) time per group, since we're iterating through each element 
            in that group (in the worst case scenario). Therefore, this requires 8*3 = 24 operations to 
            sort 8 elements resulting in a time complexity of O(n*log(n)).
