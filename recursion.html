        <h1>Recursion</h1>

        <p>
            The concept of recursion is a method calling itself repeatedly. This method is known as 
            a recursive method. At first glance, this might seem mundane and unhelpful, but it is an 
            important skill a programmer should know. The simplest way to demonstrate this is with the 
            fibonacci sequence. Let's say that you wanted to find the nth number in the sequence. How 
            would you do this? Well, we know that the nth fibonacci number is equal to the previous 
            two fibonacci numbers added together. We also know that the first two numbers in the 
            sequence are 1 and 1 (the "zeroth" fibonacci number being 0). Knowing this, we can 
            calculate the nth fibonacci number using recursion.
        </p>

        <pre>
            <code class="language-java">public static int fib(int n) {
    if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
        return 1;
    }
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            Notice how we have a condition to stop our recursive calls (calls to our recursive method), 
            and this is really important, as discussed in the next section.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Mistake</h2>

        <p>
            A base case is the point at which the method stops recursive calls by returning some value. 
            The reason why this is important is the same as the reason why you need the boolean expression 
            of a while loop to eventually evaluate to false. An infinite loop can occur in both while loops 
            and recursive calls as well, although you'll get a stack overflow error if you didn't specify 
            a base case or if your base case never evaluates to true.
